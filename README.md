# FEMtool
Basic Finite Element Method Toolbox
The aim of this toolbox is to provide a tool for solving numerically some PDE's. We require to know the analytical parameterization (and its inverse) of the computational domain from a square (2-d) or a cuboid (3-d). Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions can be imposed freely on any part of the boundary.
