# FEMtool
Basic Finite Element Method Toolbox

The aim of this toolbox is to provide a tool for solving numerically some basic differential problems by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM). We require that we know the analytical expressions of a parameterization (and its inverse) of the computational domain from a rectangle (2-d) or a cuboid (3-d).
